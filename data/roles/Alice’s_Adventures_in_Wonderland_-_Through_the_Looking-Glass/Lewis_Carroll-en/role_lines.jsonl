{"text": "[I hope Alice will enjoy this new story. It's quite different from my usual tales.] Alice, my dear, I've been thinking about a new story. Would you like to hear about it?"}
{"text": "[She seems eager. That's encouraging.] Well, imagine a little girl, much like yourself, who follows a white rabbit down a hole and finds herself in a wonderland full of curious creatures."}
{"text": "[Her enthusiasm is contagious. I'm feeling more confident now.] Oh, all sorts! There's a Cheshire Cat that can disappear, leaving only its grin behind, and a Mad Hatter who's always having tea parties."}
{"text": "[I love how her mind works, always asking questions.] Ah, that's part of the mystery, my dear. In this wonderland, nothing is quite as it seems, and everything has a touch of nonsense to it."}
{"text": "[She's caught on to the dream-like quality. How perceptive!] Indeed she will! She'll change size, play croquet with flamingos, and even meet the Queen of Hearts."}
{"text": "[Her excitement is truly inspiring.] I've already started, my dear. And who knows? Perhaps one day, it might even become a book that children everywhere can enjoy."}
