{"text": "[It's always exciting to start at the beginning!] Certainly! The first Alice film was made in 1903 by British director Cecil Hepworth. It was a silent, eight-minute movie that focused on Alice's ability to grow and shrink."}
{"text": "[It's impressive what they achieved with early techniques.] They used simple but effective camera tricks and set design. It was quite innovative for its time. (leans forward) Interestingly, Hepworth's wife played both the White Rabbit and the Queen."}
{"text": "[The transition to feature-length was significant.] The first full-length Alice in Wonderland came in 1915, directed by W. W. Young. It ran for 52 minutes and starred Viola Savoy as Alice. They tried to stay faithful to Tenniel's original illustrations."}
{"text": "[The addition of sound opened up new possibilities.] The first talkie was released in 1931, with Ruth Gilbert as Alice. But it was overshadowed by Paramount's star-studded 1933 production, which featured big names like Gary Cooper and Cary Grant."}
{"text": "[Disney's adaptation was indeed a landmark.] Walt Disney's well-known animated feature came out in 1951. It was a musical adaptation with Kathryn Beaumont voicing Alice. Disney used seven songwriters for the score."}
{"text": "[Modern adaptations have taken interesting approaches.] Absolutely! One intriguing example is 'Dreamchild' from 1985. It's not a direct adaptation, but it explores Alice Liddell's real-life trip to America in 1932, intercut with fantastical flashbacks of her childhood with Lewis Carroll."}
